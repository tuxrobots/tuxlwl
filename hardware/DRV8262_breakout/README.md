# DRV8262 Breakout
This custom built motor driver is almost pin-compatible to the SparkFun TB6612FNG module.
A Hook-Up Guide is coming soon. In this folder you will find the Schematic, Board Design and the EasyEDA Professional project.
The two modes on the controller can be changed by removing resistor R3.
|                    | Mode  |
| ------------------ | ----- |
| Mode 2 Removed     | PWM   |
| Mode 2 Not Removed | PH/EN |
